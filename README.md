## How to start the project

./mysh
```

## Commands & flags

cd ../    #go to current file path

```
setenv && unsetenv :

setenv :

```bash
setenv hello World #Create the value hello in the environment and assign the value world

setenv hello #Create value without attributed value

setenv USERNAME helloWorld #Change the value of USERNAME to helloWorld

setenv USERNAME #removes the value assigned to USERNAME

```

Unsetenv :

```bash
unsetenv hello World #remove the value hello from the env

```

Exit :

```bash
Exit #exit the program

```

## Other commands

We can also use any commands currently installed on your computer and we can run the program within the program.

```bash
./mysh

nael@nael:~/for_github/a/MyShell$ ./mysh #enter in program
```
